As you venture deeper into the dungeon, you come across a mystical 
chamber bathed in an eerie, soft glow. At the center of the chamber, 
you find an ancient, ornate pedestal, upon which rests a crystal orb. 
Inside the orb, you see a swirling mist of numbers.

A mysterious voice echoes through the chamber:

"Welcome, brave adventurer, to the Chamber of the Enchanted Riddle. 
To proceed, you must prove your wit. I present to you a riddle. 
Guess the correct number, and the path shall open."

The crystal orb begins to shimmer, revealing the riddle:

"I am a number between 0 and 10, hidden in the mists of time and magic. 
You have three attempts to unveil my secret. Choose wisely."

You take a moment to contemplate the riddle and then make your first guess. 
```

Після невірної спроби:

```
The crystal orb reacts, and the voice responds:

"The mists are stirred, but your guess is not quite right. Try again."

```

Якщо гравець робить свій останній хід: 
```
As you make your final attempt, the crystal orb pulses with anticipation. 
The voice returns one last time:

"Ah, you've reached your final choice.
Let us see if fate favors you this day."

Your heart races as you await the orb's final verdict. 
Success could reveal the path forward, but failure might have 
unforeseen consequences. The mystical chamber holds its breath, 
awaiting your decision.

Will you solve the Enchanted Riddle and continue your adventure, 
or will the chamber's secrets remain locked away? 
```

Якщо гравець виграв:

```
With a surge of anticipation, you make your guess, 
and the crystal orb responds with a brilliant, radiant light. 
The chamber trembles slightly, and you hear the voice once more, 
filled with approval:

"Congratulations, brave adventurer! You have unveiled the secret 
of the Enchanted Riddle. The magic within the chamber responds to 
your wisdom."

As the light fades, the ancient pedestal descends into the floor, 
revealing a passage leading deeper into the dungeon. You've 
successfully passed the first test and now stand at the threshold of 
greater adventures. Your journey continues, filled with mysteries, 
challenges, and treasures yet to be discovered.

Press onward, for destiny calls your name."
```

Якщо гравець програв: 
```
You've tried three times, but to no avail. 
The magical crystal orb assesses your attempts and solemnly declares:

"Fate did not favor you today, brave adventurer. 
Your knowledge proved insufficient, and you have not passed the trial."

For unknown reasons, darkness shrouds the ceiling of the 
crystal orb, and you feel a chilling breath enveloping you. 
Your world fades away due to your incorrect answers.

The game has come to an end for you, but perhaps another 
adventurer will dare to test their mettle in this ancient and 
mysterious chamber.

The end of your journey. Your story concludes."

Welcome to Level 2: "The Monty Hall Paradox"

You find yourself in a grand hall, adorned with opulent tapestries and 
intricate carvings. At the center of the room, there are three 
ornate doors, each leading to a different, mysterious destination. 
As you approach, a captivating voice echoes through the hall:

"Welcome back, intrepid adventurer, to a place where intuition 
will be tested. You stand before the Monty Hall Paradox, a puzzle 
of probabilities and choices. Are you ready to unravel its secrets?"

The voice continues:

"Behind one of these three doors lies unimaginable treasure, 
while behind the other two, well, let's just say there's something 
less desirable. Your goal is simple: choose one door. But beware, 
after your initial choice, one of the other doors, concealing an 
undesirable outcome, will be revealed to you. You will then have the 
opportunity to switch your choice or stay with your original decision. 
The question is, what will you do?"

As you ponder the enigmatic challenge before you, 
the voice encourages you:

"Make your choice wisely, adventurer, and let the Monty 
Hall Paradox begin!"
```
Після вибору:

```

You carefully make your initial choice, pointing to one of the three doors. 
The voice acknowledges your selection with a knowing tone:

"Very well, brave adventurer. You have chosen Door {Your Chosen Door Number}."

As you await the next revelation, the voice adds:

"Now, let's add a twist to this challenge. 
Before I reveal what's behind your chosen door, allow me to make things 
more interesting. Out of the two remaining doors, one will be shown to you, 
revealing an outcome you'd rather avoid."

With a dramatic flourish, one of the other two doors swings open, 
revealing a room with wild tigers therein. 

"You see, adventurer, you now have a unique opportunity. 
You can either stick with your original choice, 
or you can switch to the other unopened door. The decision is yours."

The choice weighs heavily on your mind. What will you do?
```

Якщо гравець виграв

```
With a thoughtful decision, you make your choice. 
Your heart pounds as you await the final revelation.

The voice nods approvingly and then dramatically declares:

"Let us unveil the truth behind your chosen door."

The door you selected swings open slowly, and to your amazement, 
a dazzling array of treasures spills out before you. 
Gold coins, precious gems, and artifacts of untold value glisten 
in the soft light of the chamber.

The voice speaks once more, filled with admiration:

"Congratulations, wise adventurer! You have conquered the 
Monty Hall Paradox and claimed the coveted treasure. 
Your intuition and daring have paid off."

As you revel in your victory, you can't help but feel a 
sense of accomplishment and excitement for the adventures that lie ahead. 
You've proven your mettle once again, and your journey continues, 
richer and more thrilling than ever before.

Well done! Your victory propels you further into the heart of the unknown."
```

```
With bated breath, you watch as the door you've chosen swings open, 
revealing a chilling and deadly sight. Instead of treasure, 
you find yourself face to face with a room teeming with 
ferocious wild tigers, their eyes fixed hungrily upon you.

The voice speaks, its tone filled with regret and concern:

"Disaster has befallen you, adventurer. Behind the door you selected, 
an untamed and perilous fate awaited. The tigers hunger for their next 
meal, and it appears you are on the menu."

As terror grips your heart, you realize that your journey has met 
a tragic end. Your adventure concludes here, in this harrowing 
chamber of doom. The treasure you sought remains forever out of reach,
and the Monty Hall Paradox takes on a new and terrifying meaning.

In the world of adventure, choices can lead to triumph or tragedy. 
Your story has ended, but remember it as a cautionary tale for those 
who dare to venture into the unknown.

Game over, brave adventurer. May you find peace in the great beyond."

You progress deeper into the dungeon, leaving behind the enigmatic 
Monty Hall Paradox. As you move forward, you enter a chamber unlike 
any you've encountered before. The air is thick with arcane energy, 
and the walls shimmer with ancient runes.

A commanding voice resonates through the chamber:

"Welcome, seeker of knowledge, to the Mystical Equation Chamber.
Here, the very fabric of magic intertwines with mathematics, 
and your skills will be tested in a most extraordinary way."

The voice continues:

"Before you lies a series of enchanted equations, 
each holding a key to unlock the next part of your journey. 
These equations are no ordinary puzzles; they are the embodiment 
of magical forces, waiting for you to decipher their secrets."

You gaze upon the equations, and they seem to shift and transform, 
as if alive. The voice explains:

"To move forward, you must solve these mystical equations. 
Time is your enemy, for the magic that binds them is fleeting. 
Solve each equation swiftly, or the opportunity will vanish."

The first equation appears before you, and you sense the urgency 
of the task at hand. The voice concludes:

"Brace yourself, brave adventurer. The Mystical Equation Chamber awaits, 
and only your intellect and quick thinking will reveal the path ahead."

With a sense of determination, you step forward to tackle the magical 
equations, knowing that each solution brings you closer to the heart 
of the dungeon's mysteries.
```

Якщо гравець впорався з усіма рівняннями

```
With determination and quick thinking, you tackle each 
of the mystical equations presented before you. 
As your answers align with the hidden magic within them, 
a profound transformation takes place within the chamber.

The arcane energy surges, and the walls of the Mystical 
Equation Chamber resonate with a powerful enchantment. 
A brilliant portal of light materializes before you, leading 
to a new path deeper into the dungeon.

The commanding voice speaks once more, filled with admiration:

"Remarkable! Your intellect and resolve have unlocked 
the secrets of the Mystical Equation Chamber. 
You have harnessed the magic within and earned the right to 
proceed."

With a sense of accomplishment, you step through the portal, 
ready to face whatever challenges and mysteries lie ahead. 
Your adventure continues, guided by your newfound mastery 
over the mystical forces that dwell within these ancient depths.

Well done, brave adventurer! Your journey into the unknown persists."
```

Якщо гравець не встиг

```
As you feverishly attempt to solve the last mystical equation, 
you feel the energy in the chamber growing more unstable. 
The equations resist your efforts, and the magical symbols 
start to flicker and fade.

Time slips through your fingers like sand, and as the final 
seconds pass, the equations dissolve into a maelstrom of 
chaotic magic. The chamber trembles, and a surge of mystical 
energy engulfs you.

The commanding voice speaks one last time, its tone filled 
with regret:

"Alas, adventurer, the sands of time have run out. 
The magic within these equations remains a mystery, 
and the price for failure is steep."

Suddenly, the magical energy intensifies, and you are 
consumed by a vortex of uncontrollable forces. Your vision blurs, 
and the world around you disintegrates into a kaleidoscope 
of colors.

Your adventure ends here, in a disorienting whirl of magic. 
The mysteries of the dungeon shall remain unsolved, and your 
story concludes in the depths of uncertainty.

Game over, brave adventurer. May your spirit find peace 
amidst the magic that now surrounds you."
